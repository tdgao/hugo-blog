# Introduction

***Welcome!***

This is a place for writers.  I am pleased to say I've discovered creative writing a handful of years ago, and never looked back.  There are no expectations, no rules, no pressure.  Because everything falls away and finally, I can be *me*, completely, fully---free.  

I know it's the same for you.

Let's start at the beginning.

My name is Danielle, and as a writer in bloom, here are a few things you should know about me:

Likes:

- Genres of Tragedy, Angst, Hurt/Comfort, Friendship, Psychological

- Romance that is slow and burning and takes a back-seat to the plot. Me likey. Me likey A LOT.

- Angsty male characters that have a tortured soul

- Strong female characters (that kick butt!)

- Sibling relationships

- Beautiful metaphors

- Paradoxes

Dislikes:

- Badly written love triangles (don't we all?)

- Mary Sues (again, don't we all?)

- 'Love at First Sight' ---nope.

My writing style concentrates on feeling, not description.  I use many commas, start sentences with "And" and "Because", tend to have paragraphs that are max. 4 sentences long (working on that), I fail at poetry, and I like Third Person present-tense P.O.V best.

I'm looking forward to sharing with you.  Still a beginner, I hope to improve in many ways.

Into the happy place of writing we go!
