*Poem inspired by First & Last - Amelie Pascual*

*To the Desert - Benjamin Alire  Sáenz*

*It may not always be so; and I say - E.E Cummings*

*When you are old - W.B Yeats*

*This is Just to Say - William Carlos Williams*



**It's been so long**



It's been so long, that

I can't remember the way you smile

Or

What shade of blue your eyes were

Not even

The small gestures of your hands, fluttering

Out of the corner of my eye

It's been so long, that

I can't remember the warmth of you

That used to be so

comforting

And sweet

Your laughing face lit golden

By the sun

And even though

It's been so long

I still wish



We could return to those days
