**Coldness**

Her hands were cold.

It was the first thing he had noticed; when she spoke to him, held out her hand, her touch chilled him to the bone.

It was an ice and diamonds thrill, at first.  Her eyes glittered behind wire-framed glasses, skin smooth and so very pale.  She was beautiful; with a kind of faraway beauty, like snow on a distant mountaintop.  They had met in school, and he had almost always walked her home afterwards.  He wanted to get to know her better, as she was a bright, intelligent girl whose true thoughts always remained a mystery.   Her smile was entrancing, she was entrancing; like a snowflake, a shock of cold, a sip of refreshment.  Today, she had invited him inside her house.

The air was dry and empty inside, with a grey cement floor and plain white walls.  Few pieces of furniture were present.  The smell of sterility and hospital lingered about, like it was trying too hard to cover up something else.  The temperature was very low; he could feel the chill all the way to his bones.  He crossed his arms tightly over his chest, trying to get warm.  He was surprised that his breath didn’t fog up when he spoke, “Where is your family?  I should introduce myself.”

“Downstairs…” She smiled wide.  Her teeth were blinding white, gleaming like her glasses.  He found himself staring at the perfect spectrum of her mouth.  There was a large stone fireplace, empty of logs or fire.  Pictures of family and pets, smiling and cheerful, haunted the mantelpiece.  Everything was right, but strangely, wrong.  He didn’t know what it was, but something just seemed entirely off about her house.  She had changed, inside her house.  Something about the way she smiled, licking her lips, something about the way the temperature was so frosty, so chilling.

He was suddenly, very afraid.

Perhaps it was all a misunderstanding---

She approached him, holding her hands behind her back.

“You’ll just love what I have in store for you,” she whispered.

“Uh, I think I have to go---“

“No, no, stay.”  She smiled again, that below zero degree smile, looming over him, stepping closer.

He heard a rustling sound behind him, sending a chill up his spine. The lights seemed to dim, shadows crept along the walls.

Her smile seemed to stretch wider and wider, and he realized.  The cold was not refreshing.  The cold was not an ice and diamonds thrill.  The cold in her eyes was not beautiful.  She was not a snowflake; she was not delicate or refined.  Her eyes bored into him, glassy and staring, mouth grinning, stretched and stretched.  Her bone white hands were extending towards him, an aching, biting, dead cold.



Her smile was truly too big for her face--- the impossibly wide smile of the truly insane.
