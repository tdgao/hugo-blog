**A train that runs all the way out of the town**

Prompt: Anticipation



There is a train that runs all the way out of the town and into blue-green mountains and richly coloured fields.  It runs all the way out to big, beautiful lakes, sparkling in the sun.  To lands she can only dream of, hazy in the mist.  Her eyes can follow the train, a sliver of shining metal like a crescent moon, or a silvery teardrop, receding smaller and smaller and smaller until it finally recedes into the unknown she longs for. There is a train that runs all the way out to the cities she’s heard of, with tall, gleaming skyscrapers blocking out the skies.

Sometimes, she stands at the train station, so close to the crying mothers waving goodbye, so close she can almost feel the excitement and anxiety and freedom all tumbled in with the smell of coal burning and the low rumbles as the train begins to set off.  Sometimes, time passes before her eyes as she stays there, long after the train is gone.

Only one train runs all the way out of the town she lives in.  The town, so small it never makes it on a map.  A town of dusty dirt paths and heavy hearts and deep, endless skies that could swallow you whole, that shine too bright.  She hates the skies.  She hates feeling so vulnerable under them.  Her world is too big, too empty, too cold.  Too lonely.  The winds wrap tight around her in a land flat and plain, with shadows so long in the daytime.

So she dreams of the big cities, teeming with people and artists and musicians on the street, those tall, gleaming skyscrapers blocking out the skies above her.  She dreams of the smiling spectators, the dancing, the drinking, the mass of bodies that she can reinvent herself in.  She wishes for the day that she will be on the train that runs all the way out of the town.

Until that day comes, she’ll stand at the train station, eyes following the silver of the train, dreaming in anticipation for things that could be.
