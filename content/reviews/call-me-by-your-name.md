“We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything – what a waste.”

Warning: this review contains spoilers. However, this is the kind of novel with an experience unaffected by spoilers.

This novel, written by Andre Aciman, has affected me in a way that no other novel has. Even a year after reading it, it pervades the senses and reminds me of my ever-present desire to experience an Italian summer by the beach, drinking apricot juice.

What other word to describe it other than incredible. I truly believe everyone can relate to the novel in some way. It has the rare ability to awaken a yearning and nostalgia inside all of us that is difficult to describe. I appreciated how it ignored the linear, traditional approach of love, and rather explored the circular concept of desire, a cycle that ebbs and flows, captured beautifully. The novel’s dreamy, emotional prose matched the longing that accompanies this circular desire and portrayed the painful reminder that nothing can last forever. It gave me a vicarious reminder of the desire I’ve felt to be with certain people, how it progressed from a burning desire to an ache and an acceptance.

The year is 1983, and Elio is a precocious 17-year old who spends the summers with his family in their house on the Italian Riveria. He is the son of a professor who holds an annual fellowship with young scholars. Elio’s parents select Oliver, a 24-year old brilliant and handsome American to live with them and complete his manuscript for publication. Elio is introverted, shy and intelligent, and is quickly fascinated by Oliver, who is brazen and self-assured. His infatuation begins early on, with Elio being overwhelmed by the strength of his desire, his connection. He finds himself struggling to express his feelings or share them with anyone. Through his intense scrutinization of every little detail about Oliver, he develops a theory about the colour of Oliver’s swimsuits. “Red: bold, set in his ways, very grown-up, almost gruff and ill-tempered—stay away. Yellow: sprightly, buoyant, funny, not without barbs—don’t give in too easily; might turn to red in no time. Green: acquiescent, eager to learn, eager to speak, sunny…Blue: the afternoon he stepped into my room from the balcony, the day he massaged my shoulder, or when he picked up my glass and placed it right next to me.” I love this detail worked into the story, as it makes Elio’s desire even more vibrant, even more unmanageable.

Elio is frustrated by Oliver’s apparent indifference and changing moods, responding in turn to conceal his feelings. To further his concealment, he begins a sexual, but not romantic, relationship with Marzia, a girl his age. Meanwhile, Oliver begins seeing Chiara, a neighbour of Elio’s. Oliver states that he has no interest in Chiara, similarly, there is a certain tension and emotional distance between Marzia and Elio. The novel is filled with instances of Elio and Oliver dancing around each other, never facing the tension, the underlying subtext that goes unspoken. A pivotal scene appears when Elio’s mother translates a German tale of a princess and a knight. The knight is in love with the princess, but is overcome with anxiety about his feelings. He asks the princess, “is it better for a man to speak or to die?” This is a key theme in the novel and concisely captures Elio’s struggle. So overwhelmed by his desire, he knows that soon his feelings will become too obvious. But confessing his feelings, despite remaining hopeful that it could be reciprocated, is an insurmountable task that leaves him extremely vulnerable. Finally, on a bike trip with Oliver, Elio lets slip his feelings, rather subtly. Oliver reciprocates his desire, and they share a fleeting but happy time together. Elio has chosen to speak, but similarly to the knight, knows that this decision opens him up to more pain, more uncertainty, than perhaps even death. Therein lies the bittersweet feeling of Call Me By Your Name; by the next year, Oliver will be engaged to a woman, Elio will have his own relationships, but the desire for each other will never truly fade.

Elio’s father reveals that he knew about Elio’s feelings, and reminds Elio of the preciousness of this rare, deep connection that he himself never found in his life. He reminds the reader that feeling desire, even if unreciprocated or doomed, is a better alternative than “ripping out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should, that we go bankrupt by the age of 30 and have less to offer each time we start with someone new.” Additionally, this an encouragement for Elio, that choosing to speak rather than die was the right thing to do. For although both paths may lead to the same outcome of someone we love being with someone else, only one provides growth and development.

After Oliver gets married, Elio continues to reflect on the impact of Oliver on his life. Elio reflects, “Time makes us sentimental. Perhaps, in the end, it is because of time that we suffer.” This painfully poignant line makes us all remember the often repeated platitude of “time heals.” Perhaps this is just something you tell yourself to forget about the pain momentarily. Sometimes, time makes us suffer. Once you’ve felt a life-shattering connection for some and it’s never resolved or requited in the way you want it to, that feeling, I believe, never really goes away. Call Me By Your Name does not underestimate the power of those feelings, but acknowledges it. Years later, Elio crosses paths again with Oliver, now married with two sons. The ending is a feat in itself. It instills a strange feeling of hope, as Oliver speaks about parallel lives, and how the choices in our lives lead us down a certain path. We never know what life we would have lived if we’d chosen the other path, but the one that lives the parallel life isn’t a different person, just one version of us. In the end, we all have an essence that boils down to more than our choices in life. Andre Aciman manages to leave the reader with hope battered by regret, a bittersweet truth about love that shapes us, an acceptance of the ways that life prevents us from being with our soulmate.

**Other Notes**

Perhaps the only criticism I feel pertinent to share here is the excessive sexual explicitness of the novel, which in my opinion, detracts from its important themes. Readers may be put-off by this.

About the film adaptation: the film’s ending differs from the novel in that Elio receives a phone call during winter about Oliver’s engagement and marriage. The film ends with Elio sitting down in front of the fireplace, tears in his eyes. In the final moments, Elio’s mother calls him and he turns to look at her over his shoulder. I did not expect this ending, and do favour the novel’s ending, but I am impressed by its ability to capture the same themes. The wintery landscape reminds us of the brevity of summer, the changing seasons and the inevitable distance between Elio and Oliver. Elio looking over his shoulder represents the same battered hope present in the novel, reminding us that he will eventually move on. Timothee Chalamet’s performance, with his truly heart-wrenching expression, beautifully captures the sadness of what could have been. The soundtrack by Sufjan Stevens is a masterpiece that serves as the perfect accompaniment to the film. I enjoyed the film thoroughly as a wonderful adaptation directed by Luca Guadagnino. (Don’t forget to look for a version with subtitles to the Italian and French. That was my mistake, but I’m probably going to watch it again anyway.)
