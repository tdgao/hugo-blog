“It’s okay, it’s okay to cry. Just know that I love you forever.”

Anna is a young, silent twelve year old girl with dark, cropped hair and tomboyish clothes.  She is ineffably different from the titular character of the film, Marnie, who has long, flowing blond hair and wears feminine dresses.  Marnie extends her hand out to Anna upon their first meeting; what she shares with Anna is the unusual blue colour of her eyes, but not much else.  Marnie appears bold, confident, full of warm expression.  Yet beneath that image are mysteries upon mysteries, those that are nebulously hidden from the viewer from the start.  Her golden hair and laughter belong to a girl that Anna has dreamed about. The mansion perched across the salt marsh is abandoned, but comes to life at dusk when Marnie inhabits it.  Anna dreams of Marnie before seeing her, envisioning a girl with blond hair having her hair brushed in the window.  The girl in the dream, without seeing her face, gives the impression of being in physical pain, allowing an emotional feeling of secret helplessness corrupting the luxurious life she seems to have.

The viewer immediately wants to know more about this girl, the one who changes Anna’s perception of friendship and makes her life colourful.  Studio Ghibli’s most recent film marks a swath of uniqueness from the rest; Anna is a protagonist that despises herself, is unsociable and lonely.  Marnie opens up a world of new possibilities and experiences for Anna, but admonishes her to keep it a secret from everyone else.  When Marnie invites Anna to a ball, she clearly admires and is inspired by, maybe a little intimidated by, the beauty and wealth surrounding them and in Marnie herself.  The night air promises thrills and the girls share an emotional closeness that Anna lacks for everyone else.  Anna wakes up on the side of the road, missing a shoe, and like a dream, the night comes to an end.

The viewer learns that the mansion is being renovated for new owners, and a girl named Sayaka discovers a diary with Marnie’s name written on it hidden in a drawer.  The next day, Anna tells Marnie that she believes her foster parents only pretend to love her for the money that they receive from taking care of her.  Marnie shares that her mother and father are never with her and she is always left in the mansion with her nanny and two maids.  The maids abuse her and threaten to lock her in the silo near the mansion.  Marnie confides that she wishes she was Anna, which makes Anna realize the fortunity of her circumstances.  Even from someone as beautiful and carefree as Marnie, a deep sadness permeates her.  Anna resolves to help Marnie face her fear of the silo and help her from what she fears is a terribly lonely and frightening fate.  Anna appears changed from within, having found the first friend she deeply cares about and wishes to protect.  At the silo, Marnie disappears, and Anna finds herself alone.

The film shows a beautiful internal journey of Anna, materializing her transformation through a ghost of her familial past, revealed at the end.  Throughout the film, the viewer is constantly questioning who Marnie actually is.  The answer comes as an emotional revelation, expected but not made too obvious.  Marnie was the cure that Anna needed all along- an answer to her identity and her past.  The film reminds us that we all have or need Marnies in our lives—movements that push us to find ourselves, understand our history, show us the brightness in life.  The film ends on a hopeful note, with Anna calling her foster mother “mother” for the first time, and the promise of a lifetime friendship with Sayaka and a community Anna can always go back to.  Though Marnie is no longer there, her legacy lives on in the places that she called home, a home that Anna will forever keep in her heart.
