“But if you never do the bold stroke… you’ll never know if you could’ve had a great painting.”

Warning: the following review contains spoilers for “The Half of It”

Netflix’s release of “The Half Of It”, a film directed by Alice Wu, certainly captures the essence of its tagline “A different kind of love story.”  In fact, the love story does not take a forefront role, but is skillfully veiled and entwined with three complex and layered character studies.  At its heart, “The Half Of It” is a bold, unique coming-of-age story by the strength and development of each of its three main characters.  The film poignantly compels the viewer to reminisce of their own awkward, tumultuous journey through highschool and demonstrates the power of personal growth through pivotal friendships. Two of the characters, Ellie and Aster, live life with repressed longing from the weight of familial, societal and relational expectations, afraid to be themselves.  Paul, a humble sausage-making boy, presents an opportunity and chance to break through those expectations.   This film shows us the journey to have the bravery to act on our feelings before it’s too late, and gives us a refreshing feeling of hope, against all odds.

Ellie Chu, played by Leah Lewis, is a Chinese girl who immigrated to the fictional town of Squahamish in the United States with her widowed father when she was young.  Intelligent, tenacious, fiercely insouciant, by all means a “misfit” in the vapid popularity structure of highschool, Ellie shines as a character viewers become emotionally invested in.  We are soon given an insight on her experiences shaping her attitude, as she has been forced to mature early by the death of her beloved mother.   Robbed of luxuries and the carefree privileges of youth, she has become a diligent girl making extra money by writing her classmates’ essays and helping her father at the train station.  In the beginning, Ellie firmly lets go of her dreams and potential when she resolves not to go to Grinnell College, the college that her English teacher recommends, because she believes she needs to stay at home to take care of her father and save money.  On her emotional maturity, Ellie confesses she knows “nothing about love,” and sometimes “hides behind other people’s words.”

Her character is contrasted with that of Aster Flores, played by Alexxis Lemire, an effective foil in terms of popularity and social structure.  A classic “pretty girl”, she is dating one of the most popular, handsome and wealthy boys in the school.  The magic of her character begins when we soon find out that on the inside, she bears many similarities to Ellie.  She is intelligent, artistic and perceptive, yet feels trapped beneath others expectations.  The viewer soon realizes that she is much more than meets the eye and similarly to Ellie, feels trapped in her life.  Trig, her vain and empty-headed boyfriend, does not seem to care to see Aster beyond her societal status and appearance.  Likewise, her friends view their friendships with her as beneficial to themselves, outlined when Aster states, “when you’re a pretty girl, people want to give you things.  What they really want is to make you like them. Not like them as in, ‘I like you’, but like them as in, ‘I am like you’. So I’m like a lot of people. Which makes me kind of no one,” highlighting Aster’s confusion over her identity. The opportunity for Ellie to talk to Aster arises when Paul, professing that he is in love with Aster, asks Ellie to help him write a love letter.

Paul Munsky, played by Daniel Diemer, is a simple-minded, kind-hearted boy that presents the rare opportunity for two kindred souls like Ellie and Aster to meet, which likely would never have been possible because of perceived differences in societal status.  Similarly to them, he is bound by familial expectations through his family’s sausage making business that is passed on from generation to generation.  He is expected to take over this business and wants to modernize it, despite his family not being on board. Unlike Ellie and Aster, however, he appears to be more satisfied and rooted in his identity, knowing clearly his passions and his talents.  He frequently daydreams about his creation of a “taco sausage,” and has tried writing to food critics in larger cities.

When Ellie drops her papers in the school hallway one day, Aster stops to help her, creating their first face to face meeting.  Upon seeing her papers, Aster remarks, “Remains of the Day.  Loved it.  All that barely repressed longing.”  The Remains of the Day, a novel by Kazuo Ishiguro, is a story about an English butler who lives life repressing his emotions as his profession dictates, but realizes the price of his repression as he travels the English countryside.  Regretful and bittersweet, the novel is a perfect parallel to both Ellie and Aster’s lives.  Time can pass in the blink of an eye, lost opportunities come back to haunt you, and fleeting chances of redemption in the form of people strongly connected to you can disappear forever if you don’t take action.  Before you know it, you’re old and weak, and the brevity of life inexorably reveals your desolate heart.

These themes are invariably repeated throughout the film, with the next instance being Aster telling Ellie disguised as Paul, “I had a painting teacher once tell me that the difference between a good painting and a great painting is typically five strokes.  And they’re usually the five boldest strokes in the painting.  The question, of course, is which five strokes?” The film portrays a scene where Ellie and Aster take turns spray painting a wall, in which they come to the conclusion about what it means to act on repressed longing: to take the chance to do something bold, for the chance to go from a “good” painting to a “great” one.  The film handles Ellie and Aster’s development masterfully, shaping their understandings about love and embracing their identities. Paul also undergoes a version of this development.  Previously enamoured by Aster’s beauty, he becomes bold in taking the chance to confess his more fully realized feelings to Ellie instead.  Additionally, he becomes cognizant of Ellie’s love towards Aster, and eventually accepts it, despite his religious beliefs.

By the end of the movie, we see a transformation in all three characters.  Ellie decides to go to Grinnell college, Aster decides she wants to go to art school, refusing her boyfriend’s marriage proposal, and Paul’s sausage business increases in potential and success thanks to Ellie’s help in writing letters to food critics. Ellie kisses Aster, saying that she’ll see her in a few years.  Paul says goodbye to Ellie at the train station, and Paul chases after the train when it leaves, mirroring an act to a romantic movie that they had watched.  Previously, where Ellie found the gesture moronic, she is now delighted and looks forward to the future, representing her character’s complete arc.

I love “The Half of It” ‘s  boldness in exploring the definition of being true to who you are in love and in life.  To embrace your aspirations, your uniqueness, and acting on your feelings before it’s too late. “The Half of It” does not rely on a cheap and typical romantic ending, but executes a weighty, impactful and realistic conclusion that  still evokes a sense of hope through the personal growth and friendship of the characters.   Filled with purposeful silences, the movie is deeply introspective and offers the viewer a well-executed journey through the eyes of each character on taking charge of their own “remains of the day,” to have no regrets and instead excitement for the future, and above all, how to “do the bold stroke.”
