The Elegance of the Hedgehog, a novel translated from the French by author Muriel Barbery, is a wonderfully written, profound and inspirational book that deserves to be much more well-known than it is. It is an extraordinary character study of two kindred souls, yet complete opposites on the social hierarchy—Renee, a 54-year old concierge and Paloma, a precocious 12 year old —-linked only by their intelligence and the affluent Parisian residence they live in. Renee furtively hides her intelligence under a facade of a dull and slow witted stereotype, and Paloma becomes increasingly discouraged by the emptiness of the lives of her wealthy family and those around her. She plots to take her life on her 13th birthday and set fire to her apartment, all the while keeping a journal of things that make life worth living, in hopes that she will find something to give her hope. Both are extensively unhappy with their lives; Renee because she is disdained by the rich who encourage her belief in a world of haves and have-nots, and Paloma because she hates her family, those that perpetuate and flaunt this very belief. But this all changes with the arrival of Ozu, a wealthy Japanese man who places class and outward appearances aside in favour of recognizing Renee’s true self, and befriending Paloma.

Ozu is Barbery’s vehicle for her beliefs and admiration of Japanese aesthetics, that she compares to French aesthetics, criticizing the latter for being too pretentious and old-fashioned. As a professor of philosophy, the novel is a way for Barbery to illustrate her own thoughts about the philosophy surrounding the nature of art, beauty and taste. The novel is rife with motifs of Japanese art and culture that are used to portray the main theme of the novel: that the greatest beauty is subtle, humble and modest, found within the inconspicuous. Some of the most important motifs, I outline as following:

**The Japanese Aesthetic of Wabi-Sabi**

The word wabi in Japanese means rustic simplicity, quietness and understated elegance. It is an ideal of beauty where minor imperfections are valued more than things that are seemingly perfect. Broken or cracked utensils, as long as they have been well-repaired, are valued much more highly than intact objects. When you believe in the wabi aesthetic, even when you are in poverty stricken surroundings, no thought of hardship arises. Even amid insufficiency, there is no desire for more than you have. When faced with failure, you do not brood over the injustice of it. Those that believe in wabi never complain about unfriendly or unfavourable circumstances, or believe that poverty or insufficiency is restricting. Wabi completely contradicts the notion that beauty must be pretentious, magnificent or opulent.

Wabi has a counterpart, which is sabi. Sabi is a word that means beauty or serenity that comes with age, when the life of the object and its permanence are evident in its wear or visible repairs.

“The concept sabi carries not only the meaning ‘aged’—in the sense of ‘ripe with experience and insight’ as well as ‘infused with the patina that lends old things their beauty’—but also that of tranquility, aloneness, deep solitude”-The German commentator, Hammitzsch:

The feeling of sabi is also evoked in the haiku of the famous seventeenth-century poet Bashō. Its connection with the Japanese word sabishi meaning solitary or lonely is emphasized:

Solitary now —Standing amidst the blossomsIs a cypress tree.

Contrasting with the colourful blossoms, the more subdued gracefulness of the cypress tree portrays the poetic mood of sabi. Tanizaki’s “In Praise of Shadows,” an essay on Japanese aesthetics, celebrates sabi:

“We do not dislike everything that shines, but we do prefer a pensive lustre to a shallow brilliance, a murky light that, whether in a stone or an artifact, bespeaks a sheen of antiquity. . . . We love things that bear the marks of grime, soot, and weather, and we love the colors and the sheen that call to mind the past that made them. “

Wabi and Sabi are often put together to form a comprehensive Japanese aesthetic, called Wabi-Sabi. Wabi-Sabi principles are quiet taste, refined beauty, the belief that objects gain value through use and age, asymmetry, asperity, simplicity, austerity,modesty, intimacy and appreciation of the innocent integrity of natural objects or processes. It is centered around imperfection and transience). Beauty is found in the “imperfect, impermanent and incomplete.”

This concept is derived from the Buddhist teaching of the three marks of existence: impermanence (not lasting), suffering and emptiness/absence of self-natureAfter centuries of incorporating artistic and buddhist influences from China, Wabi-Sabi evolved into a distinct Japanese ideal. In Essays in Idleness Kenkō asks,

“Are we to look at cherry blossoms only in full bloom, at the moon only when it is cloudless?”To long for the moon while looking on the rain, to lower the blinds and be unaware of the passing of the spring—these are even more deeply moving. Branches about to blossom or gardens strewn with faded flowers are worthier of our admiration.”

Wabi principles were first recognized and praised in poetry, when it originally referred to the loneliness of living in nature, remote from society Sabi originally meant “chill” “lean” or “withered.” Around the 14th century these principles began to become more positive and hopeful. Around 700 years ago, particularly among the Japanese nobility, understanding emptiness and imperfection was honoured as the first step to enlightenment.

I believe that Barbery meant for Renee to be a symbol of this aesthetic. In chapter six in part two, Ozu gives Renee a copy of Anna Karenina that is wabi, “ It’s a book, a fine edition bound in navy blue leather of a coarse texture that is very wabi.” This symbolizes the point in the novel where Ozu realizes that Renee is not all that she seems, that she has a simple elegance that is understated and hidden. Even though in the beginning, Renee describes herself as “short, ugly and plump,” Paloma and Ozu realize that she has the elegance and beauty of a hedgehog. Paloma describes her, as quoted:

“Madame Michel has the elegance of the hedgehog: on the outside she is covered in quills, a real fortress, but my gut feeling is that on the inside, she has the same simple refinement as the hedgehog: a deceptively indolent little creature, fiercely solitary–and terribly elegant. ”

A simple elegance is also found in wabi, “an understated form of beauty, a quality of refinement masked by rustic simplicity,” which is how it is described in the book. Barbery uses this aspect to highlight what kind of beauty Renee possesses.

**The Aesthetics of Japanese Food**

Tea

As the story progresses, the reader learns about Renee’s low self-esteem due to trauma from her poverty-stricken early life and death of her husband, as well as the death of her sister. Her sister, having married a wealthy man but cast aside and left to die later on, fuels Renee’s belief that her social status sentences her to a lifetime of hiding her intelligence and not trying to move up in society. Manuela, a cleaning lady and Renee’s best friend, drinks tea together with her in a pivotal scene. Renee reflects, “When tea becomes ritual, it takes its place at the heart of our ability to see greatness in small things. Where is beauty to be found? In great things that, like everything else, are doomed to die, or in small things that aspire to nothing, yet know how to set a jewel of infinity in a single moment?”

Renee’s appreciation of the tea ritual is rooted in its simplicity, its ability to introduce harmony in a corrupt world. In the Japanese tea ritual, the teahouse and the utensils in the ceremony encompass elegant simplicity. The empty space in the teahouse room is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within the emptiness. “Tea is the beverage of the wealthy and of the poor,” indicating that Renee and Manuela are able to feel like “aristocrats of taste” despite their low social status. With every sip of tea, the drinker enjoys the moment of spiritual and moral purity and feels comforted by the unchanging nature of the tea ritual, “a fragment of eternity that has come to enrich time”.

Paloma describes her father as drinking a strong cup of coffee and reading the newspaper every morning. She states that is the way he “constructs himself,” by using them to transform himself into his adult identity. Paloma claims this identity is simply a mask that “tells you the lies you need to believe.” Paloma reflects on French cuisine being stuffy, pretentious and old, while Japanese cuisine seems eternal, divine, refined and moderate due to its simplicity. She decides to have jasmine tea for breakfast: “Tea and mangas instead of coffee and newspapers: something elegant and enchanting, instead of adult power struggles and their sad aggressiveness.”

Gyoza, Ramen and Sashimi

Ozu invites Renee over to his apartment for dinner for the first time. Renee is hesitant to accept because she still sees herself as unworthy and unlikeable as a friend. Ozu slowly brings down her barriers and shows that she has no reason to hide her intelligence.Ozu serves gyoza with soy sauce and a dish that he calls “zalu ramen,” cold noodles with a slightly sweet peanut dipping sauce. Eating the dish causes a slurping of the noodles, that Ozu demonstrates and Renee follows. Ozu also waves around a gyoza in his chopsticks while they are conversing, portraying that the food he has chosen is for the purpose of allowing Renee to show her true self comfortably. The dishes are meant to be indulgent but not pretentious, mirroring how Renee sees Ozu as someone who views the world with indulgence and curiosity.

Ozu invites Renee to a restaurant to celebrate his birthday. At first, she declines, but after confiding in Paloma about her past, she accepts. Renee has transformed at this point: the residents she passes on her way to the dinner with Ozu do not recognize her, while Ozu states that he would have ”recognized her anywhere,” demonstrating that he has always seen her inner beauty. Ozu and Renee have sashimi, and Renee describes a piece of octopus as so heavenly that it is a “morsel of eternity.” Renee chokes on her sashimi when Ozu reveals his romantic feelings for her. Despite her choking, he goes on to say, “we can be friends. We can be anything we want to be.” The choice of sashimi serves to further emphasize the ability of Ozu to see beauty in simplicity, and especially the beauty within Renee, something that she has never seen herself. Sashimi, like the other food items, is a simple, but elegantly beautiful dish that is meant to mirror Renee’s beauty.

**The Aesthetic of Still-Life Paintings**

When Renee is invited to Ozu’s apartment for dinner for the first time, she sees a large copy of a famous Pieter Claesz still-life painting of a scene with a half peeled lemon, oysters and a bread roll. Pieter Claesz is a 16th century Dutch Painter known for his subdued still life’s of household objects, focusing on the subtlety of light and texture. The painting is beautiful in its simplicity. It represents inner and pure beauty that is not found commonly or can be seen from the surface. Renee is enraptured, commenting “when we gaze at a still life, when—even though we did not pursue it— we delight in its beauty, a beauty borne away by the magnified and immobile figuration of things.” This scene truly symbolizes the turnaround point where Renee realizes Ozu is the exact person she needed to be able to see her simplistic beauty and elegance. Ordinary people, who desire and long for a beauty part of their projects and are constantly wanting what they do not have, are unable to appreciate another’s timeless beauty. Ozu appreciating the painting shows his ability to see past the prejudice that clouds others when looking at Renee. Only when one stops looking for an obvious beauty they desire can one truly appreciate the timelessness of others passions and emotions. Renee is tempted to once again feign ignorance and hide behind her facade, but is unable to, realizing Ozu can see beyond it. Instead she states “it’s so beautiful”; this sentence has a double meaning in that it refers to her subconscious realization that she has beauty in her, and it deserves to be seen and coveted by only those who are not expectant of it. Her beauty is found akin to the still life art, as she puts it “for art is emotion without desire, beauty without will”. Without desiring or forcing things to happen, Ozu is able to see Renee’s beauty and elegance, the timelessness of qualities such as intelligence and perseverance in her life.

**Final Thoughts**

It is implied that Ozu develops romantic feelings for Renee when he says “we can be anything we want to be”. Ozu sees Renee as a beautiful person, he sees her inner and understated beauty that stems from her intelligence and experiences. When he tells her she is not her sister, she breaks down crying, realizing that she is ready to love and show her true self to others, mentioning “these so wabi still lifes” in her thoughts. This is the point where Renee feels beautiful for the first time, and finally ready to love Ozu back. All of the motifs used emphasize that Renee, a poor and unattractive concierge, can possess the most meaningful beauty— an inner beauty that is understated and elegant inside. Interestingly enough, Barbery judges not just French but classic western beauty ideals: something perfect, enduring or monumental, like what slick massively marketed objects, like the latest iphones, aesthetically represent. Perfection is highly valued in our culture, as we often define beauty as close to perfection. Barbery discards this in favour of arguing that imperfection is as beautiful and just as valuable as perfection. Perhaps only when we realize this aesthetic do we truly appreciate those that love others because of their imperfections, their wear and tear, their scars that illustrate their mortal journeys throughout life.

Leonard Koren, an American aesthetics writer, says: “By analogy, if you fall in love with someone or something—say a physically unattractive person, place, or thing—thereafter you will perceive this someone or something as beautiful (at least some of the time), even if the rest of the world doesn’t.”

The ending of the novel, though bittersweet, is a perfect encapsulation of Renee and Paloma’s character arcs. Perhaps after all that, Barbery still manages to ground the reader in realism: that although Renee is ready to love Ozu, there are too many obstacles in the way. I deeply appreciate the ending, as realistic as it is, it remains hopeful. It quite poetically gives Paloma a reason to live, and a reason to exalt the quiet but formidable victories of the inconspicuous; a way to see the elegance of the hedgehog.
